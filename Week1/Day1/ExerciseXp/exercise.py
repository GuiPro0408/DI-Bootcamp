# 🌟 Exercise 1 : Hello World
# Instructions
# Print the following output in one line of code:
#
# Hello world

# 🌟 Exercise 2 : Some Math
# Instructions
# Write code that calculates the result of:
#
# (99^3)*8 (meaning 99 to the power of 3, times 8).

result = (99 ** 3) * 8
print(result)

# 🌟 Exercise 3 : What is the output ?
# Instructions
# Predict the output of the following code snippets:
#
# >>> 5 < 3
# >>> 3 == 3
# >>> 3 == "3"
# >>> "3" > 3
# >>> "Hello" == "hello"

# Predictions:
# 5 < 3: False
# 3 == 3: True
# 3 == "3": False (different types)
# "3" > 3: TypeError (comparing str and int)
# "Hello" == "hello": False (case-sensitive comparison)

# 🌟 Exercise 4 : Your computer brand
# Instructions
# Create a variable called computer_brand which value is the brand name of your computer.

computer_brand = "MSI"
print(f"I have a {computer_brand} computer.")

# 🌟 Exercise 5 : Your information

# Create a variable called info and set it’s value to an interesting sentence about yourself. The sentence must contain all the variables created in parts 1, 2, and 3.
# Have your code print the info message.
# Run your code.

name = "Guillaume Juste"
age = 23
shoe_size = 44
info = f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and my shoe size is {shoe_size}."
print(info)

# 🌟 Exercise 6 : A & B
# Instructions
# Create two variables, a and b.
# Each variable’s value should be a number.
# If a is bigger than b, have your code print "Hello World".

a = 10
b = 5

if a > b:
    print("Hello World")

# 🌟 Exercise 7 : Odd or Even
# Instructions
# Write code that asks the user for a number and determines whether this number is odd or even.

number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"The number {number} is even.")
else:
    print(f"The number {number} is odd.")

# 🌟 Exercise 8 : What’s your name ?
# Instructions
# Write code that asks the user for their name and determines whether or not you have the same name. Print out a funny message based on the outcome.

user_name = input("What is your name? ")
my_name = "Guillaume"

if user_name.lower() == my_name.lower():
    print("Wow, we have the same name! Great minds think alike!")

# 🌟 Exercise 9 : Tall enough to ride a roller coaster

if height > 145:
    print("You are tall enough to ride the roller coaster!")
else:
    print("You need to grow some more to ride the roller coaster.")
